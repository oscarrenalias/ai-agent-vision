# Adding a Price Comparison Feature to AI Agent Vision

This is an interesting feature that would add significant value to your receipt analysis application. Let me outline how you could approach implementing a price comparison feature that checks other retailers for potential savings.

## High-Level Approach

1. Extract items from processed receipts - Functionality already exists.
2. Search for equivalent items at other retailers - This is the new component
3. Compare prices and calculate potential savings - Analysis component
4. Present findings to the user - UI component

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Data Sources for Price Comparison

You'll need access to current pricing data from other retailers. Options include:

• **Web scraping** - Create scrapers for major retailer websites
• **Public APIs** - Some retailers offer product search/pricing APIs
• **Third-party price comparison APIs** - Services like Skyscanner for products
• **Affiliate marketing APIs** - Amazon Product API, Walmart API, etc.

### 2. Item Matching Approach

This is the most challenging part. You need to match items from receipts to equivalent products:

• **Text-based matching** - Use product names and descriptions
• **LLM-powered matching** - Use an LLM to understand product equivalence
• **Barcode/UPC matching** - If you have barcode data (future feature)

### 3. Technical Implementation

#### Backend Components:

backend/
  agents/
    price_comparison_agent.py  # New agent for price lookups
  common/
    price_sources/  # Adapters for different price sources
      retailer_a_adapter.py
      retailer_b_adapter.py
      retailer_c_adapter.py
    models/
      price_comparison.py  # Data models for comparison results


#### LLM Integration:

The LLM could help with:
• Normalizing product descriptions for better matching
• Determining if products are truly equivalent (e.g., "organic milk 1L" vs "whole milk 1L")
• Analyzing and summarizing potential savings
• Generating natural language explanations of findings

### 4. Workflow

1. User uploads receipt and gets standard analysis
2. User clicks "Compare Prices" button
3. System extracts key items from receipt
4. For each item:
   • Query 2-3 alternative retailers for equivalent products
   • LLM helps determine best matches
   • Store price differences
5. Aggregate results and show potential savings
6. Present detailed breakdown of where savings could be found

### 5. Challenges to Consider

• **Rate limiting** - Retailers may limit API calls or block scrapers
• **Data accuracy** - Prices change frequently
• **Product matching accuracy** - Different naming conventions make matching difficult
• **Regional pricing** - Prices vary by location
• **Special offers** - Hard to account for temporary discounts
• **Performance** - Real-time price checking could be slow

### 6. Potential AWS Services to Leverage

• **AWS Lambda** - Run price checking functions
• **Amazon DynamoDB** - Cache price data
• **Amazon SQS** - Queue price check requests
• **Amazon Bedrock** - LLM for product matching and analysis

## Implementation Phases

I recommend a phased approach:

1. Phase 1: Implement basic price comparison for a limited set of common grocery items against 1-2 major retailers
2. Phase 2: Expand retailer coverage and improve matching accuracy
3. Phase 3: Add historical price tracking to identify trends and optimal purchase timing

## Next Steps

1. Research available price data sources for your target retailers
2. Create a proof of concept for item matching using your preferred LLM
3. Design the data model for storing comparison results
4. Implement a basic UI to display potential savings

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this implementation plan?
