# Dockerfile for CI: expects pre-built .next, node_modules, etc.
# This file significantly speeds up the CI process as it doesn't need to build the app from
# scratch every time for the x86 and arm64 architectures, which can take a long time and a lot
#Â of storage space.
#
# For cleaner builds, use the regular Dockerfile in this directory.
